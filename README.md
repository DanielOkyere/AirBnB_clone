# AirBnB clone - The console



The console is the first part of the **AirBnB clone** project which aims to deploy a simple copy of the AirBnB website to cover all fundamental concepts of the ALX School higher level programming track.  



## Overview



This first part of the project focuses on creating a command interpreter that allows to:  

- create the data model.  

- manage (create, update and destroy) objects via a console.  

- store and persist objects to a file (JSON file).
